# This-Was-Me
Something that records everything you do in your life, whenever you want to record it. Wether its no stop, or paused every once in a while. Collects cool personal data like  what songs you listen to the most, favorite places visited the most, words used most, how many times you said i love you, etc.
None of the data can be released until you pass away. You can pick which ones get the info like a beneficiary. Its deletes the bad or negative things and events automatically. Have a search bar where if i wanted to know how many times my dad went to our favorite fishing hole in the 3 years prior to his death, itll tell me how many times he was there. gathered by tracking and location data. A rememberence and reminder of great people we have lost, and miss. Tells us what they stood for and how many times they validated their morales.
